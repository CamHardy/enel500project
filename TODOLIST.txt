How to Compile if you're on the Robot Comp (Tough luck if you're at home)
g++ read_motor_position.cpp -I$HOME/Downloads/DynamixelSDK/c++/build/linux64 -L/opt/lib -l dxl_x64_cpp -o read_motor_position

(Since the Dynamixel SDK is a shared object not in the same file and I couldn't be bothered to mess with the Make Files at this time)

First Push:
-Adapted DynamixelSDK examples to read present values of motors 
-Communication with motors and "physical limits" established

January 2nd:
-Successful writes to Head Motor and movement with button presses
-Defined phyiscal limits in file for ease of use

MAJOR TO DO LIST:
-CLEAN UP THE CODE AND MODULARIZE IT
-Write functions and/or classes to separate the different limbs and motors
-Create a fake GUI for unit testing
-Figure out how to move the cpp files to work with ROS
